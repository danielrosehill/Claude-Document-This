Thanks for fixing this!

I keep a Notion workspace for the purpose of documenting these fixes.

Please use the Notion MCP to create a new page with this technical reference.

Ensure that the markdown is Notion-compatible.

# Note Writing Guidelines

Here's what's important:

- Document the date: use the time MCP or ask me if that fails
- Documenting the fix thoroughly

Here's an approximate template to use. It is flexible. But demonstrates how I would like the information organised:

(START TEMPLATE)

# Title For The Note

## Problem

Summarise the problem that we resolved. Or what we optimised.

## Fix

Summarise the fix/remediation/optimisation.

If we tried several failed approaches first, note them only if that information might be significant in the future. Otherwise, we can just document what worked.

(END TEMPLATE)

General guidelines:

- Code blocks in code fences
- Use headings and subheadings to group information
- Make the content clear and searchable

# Full Workflow

Use the Notion MCP to create the page in my workspace.

So the full workflow here:

1) Use the time MCP to get the current date
2) Format the technical reference following the template above
3) Use the Notion MCP to create the page
4) Confirm the page has been created successfully
5) Task is complete.
