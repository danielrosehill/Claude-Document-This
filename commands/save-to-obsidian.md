Thanks for fixing this!

I keep an Obsidian notebook for the purpose of documenting these fixes.

Here's the path:

/home/daniel/obsidian-notebooks/notes-from-ai

Please create a markdown document in the notebook. 

Ensure that the markdown is Obsidian friendly. 

The notebook is ordered by topic - or intended to be. Folders might be "GPU-Fixes" (etc). If there isn't a folder for this type of information yet, create one before creating the note itself. 

# Note Writing Guidelines

Here's what's important:

- Document the date: use the time MCP or ask me if that fails 
- Documenting the fix thoroughly

Here's an approximate template to use. It is flexible. But demonstrates how I would like the information organised:

(START TEMPLATE)

# Title For The Note  

## Problem 

Summarise the problem that we resolved. Or what we optimised. 

## Fix 

Summarise the fix/remediation/optimisation.

If we tried several failed approaches first, note them only if that information migth be significant in the future. Otherwise, we can just document what worked. 

(END TEMPLATE)

General guidelines:

- Code blocks in code fences 
- Use subheadings to group information

# Full Workflow 

After creating the note push the Obsidian notebook to Github.

So the full workflow here:

1) Create the note in the Obsidian notebook 
2) Push to remote 
3) Task is complete.
